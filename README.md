# LUSA
A DIY Arduino Nano proximity sensor for your car

## What is this?
LUSA is a begginer-friendly Arduino project which combines basic PCB designing and 3D printing to make a simple, yet useful, proximity sensor for your car.

## Which skills do I need?
The basic skills needed for doing this project yourself are:
- Basic soldering skills
- Very basic Arduino Knowledge
- Knowing well your car

However I also recommend knowing this (especially for adjusting this project for yourself, or making some slight changes to, for example, the printable parts): 
- Basic coding skills (Arduino or similar languages like C/C++)
- Basic 3D printing skills 
- Basic PCB designing 
- A bit of electronics

## What do I need for making this myself?
