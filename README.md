# LUSA
A DIY Arduino Nano proximity sensor for your car

## What is this?
LUSA is a begginer-friendly Arduino project which combines basic PCB designing and 3D printing to make a simple, yet useful, proximity sensor for your car. Similarly to modern cars it uses a speaker/buzzer to beep more and more if the car gets way to close to an obstacle. This project also adds some LEDs to know better how close you are!

## Which skills do I need?
The basic skills needed for doing this project yourself are:
- Basic soldering skills
- Very basic Arduino knowledge
- Knowing well your car

However I also recommend knowing this (especially for adjusting this project for yourself, or making some slight changes to, for example, the printable parts): 
- Basic coding skills (Arduino or similar languages like C/C++)
- Basic 3D printing skills 
- Basic PCB designing 
- A bit of electronics

## What do I need for making this myself?
The parts used are:
- x5 LEDs (5 different colors)
- x5 Resistors (220 Ohms or 1K)
- x1 Active Buzzer (or similar)
- x1 Ultrasonic sensor (I used SR04)
- Arduino Nano (preferably with pins attached to it)
- The PCB in this repo (can be ordered online)
- The case for the PCB
- The case for protecting the SR04 (if you use this one)

I assume you also have:
- A PC for flashing to Arduino
- A soldering iron or soldering station
- A 3D printer (or access to a service like [Shapeways](shapeways.com))
- Some cables to attach the sensor to the Arduino
